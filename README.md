# nescala-2023-planning
Issues and documents specific to Boston in 2023

**Important:** this is a public repo, visible to the world. We don't have a ton of secret information, but anything of the sort absolutely does not belong here! Serious secrets (especially credentials and double-especially the bank and legal credentials) should be shared only via LastPass.

The [Master Checklist](master-checklist.md) is a high-level overview of the schedule for the year. Specific items should become Issues in this repo.

We have a number of other resources, including:

- [Repo for the NE Scala website](https://github.com/nescalas/nescalas.github.io)
- [The nescala Slack group](https://nescala.slack.com/), which is used for quick communication, both internally for the organizers and externally to the general NE Scala community.
- [The nescalas Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/nescalas)
- [The NE Scala 2021 Querki Space](https://querki.net/u/jducoeur/ne-scala-2021/), which is basically a simple database, where we are keeping contact information and suchlike. (Needs renaming. See Justin for access.)
- The NE Scala Google Drive, where documents generally are kept. Open only to organizers; ask for access via Slack.
