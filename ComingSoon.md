## NE Scala is returning!

Lots more info to come, but the NE Scala conference will be held in late October 2023. Specifically:

* Thursday, Oct 26 -- The Typelevel Summit
* Friday, Oct 27 -- NE Scala
* Saturday, Oct 28 -- The Unconference

We'll be doing this as an online-centric conference this year: we're still picking up the pieces as the pandemic winds down, so we're going to walk before we try to run. (Hopefully we'll have all the pieces together for more of an in-person gathering next year.)

Expect to see a Call For Papers in the near future, so start thinking about whether you have anything fun to talk about!

Note that the official URL to bookmark for the conference is [nescala.org](https://nescala.org); there will be a proper website coming there soon. (The old nescala.io domain got squatted in the interim between conferences.)
Similarly, the official feed for the conference is [@nescala@fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/@nescala) -- the old Twitter feed is completely dead, so just ignore that.
